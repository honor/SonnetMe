# Sonnet Me

Sonnet Me is an ongoing poetry project in which I write a couplet each day, a sonnet each week, for the rest of my life. See the most current live version at [*sonnet.me*] (http://sonnet.me/).

The code does not yet include a test suite. I am still experimenting with the form and structure of the site for now, and will be updating frequently in the coming months.

The site was built with *Rails 4.0* and *Ruby 2.0.0*.

Launched August 2013.
